            <div class="policy-condition__paragraph">
                    A) Demographic Information. <br>
                <p class="indented">
                    For some activities, your handset may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding you, your mobile device or location to the Company. The Company may use that information
                    to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide that information to advertisers and other parties with whom we have a business relationship. In addition, the Company
                    may use any such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheating and other improper or unlawful activities), or enforcement purposes.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    When you use this App, we may, at our option, automatically collect and store the following types of non-personally identifiable information received from you:
                    <br>
                    (i) click-through statistics.<br>
                    (ii) behavioral usage of the App<br>
                    (iii) your country.<br>
                    (iv) the type of mobile operating system you are using.<br>
                    (v) the date and time you access this App and the duration of your visit.<br>
                    (vi) mobile page views.<br>
                    (vii) the type of handset device and mobile operating system you are using<br>
                    (e.g. Android, iPhone, etc…). The Company only uses this data in aggregate form, for statistical purposes, and not in a manner that would give the Company sufficient information to identify you
                    personally. Automatically collected information of that kind typically provides us with a greater understanding regarding the use of this App, including which features are the most popular with
                    our visitors, what types of content, games, offers and products our users are interested in, where they are generally located and what are their general mobile usage behavioral patterns. That
                    information also allows us to determine if this App is working properly, make changes to the App that allows users to have better experiences on the App, and improve the App, our offers and
                    promotional content so that they are more relevant to our users. We collect that information and track it for statistical purposes; we do not use it to identify or to market to a particular
                    user. This information may be shared with advertisers, fulfillment partners and other third parties on an aggregated basis, but it does not include the Personal Information of individual
                    users (defined below).
                </p>

                    B) Personal Information. <br>
                <p class="indented">
                    NOTE: This App is not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personal Information about visitors under 13 years of age. For more information please see Section 9, “What About Children,” below.

                <p class="indented">
                    The Company may also, at its option, collect personally identifiable information from you when you use some of the features on the App. The Company stores your Personal Information on its servers and/or may share
                    and store such Personal Information with third party subcontractors, affiliates of the Company, retailers, fulfillment partners and marketing partners.

                <p>
                    “Personal Information” may include, without limitation: your first and last name, gender, your email address, your cell phone number, date of birth, PayPal or Venmo email address and accountname
                    (for sending payments), geographiclocation, game feature uses and preferences, and other demographic information that could help identify you. We may obtain some Personal Information through your
                    Facebook account if you register through your Facebook credentials. If you have set up an account that is password protected in order to use any feature on the App or for any other purpose for which
                    a password is needed, that password is also part of your Personal Information. It may be possible to use portions of this App without providing any Personal Information, but it may be necessary to provide
                    Personal Information to utilize all features of this App, including, without limitation, receiving payments if you win.

                <p class="indented">
                    The Company has taken reasonable steps to provide that all Personal Information collected by us through the App will remain secure. For example, if our App provides an opportunity for users
                    to purchase virtual goods, we will use industry-standard, SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption through third party providers like PayPal or Venmo for making and receiving payment.
                    In addition, we take reasonable steps to require that these third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of Personal Information received from us.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    However, no Internet, mobile or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail or SMS message sent or any other information or data sent to or from our servers
                    over the public Internet may not be secure. Therefore, users should therefore take special care in deciding what information they send to Company through an Internet connection or mobile network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can help us to protect your Personal Information by: <br>
                    (i) ensuring your handset device is locked. <br>
                    (ii) not sharing any password or log-in data with
                    others. <br>
                    (iii) changing your password frequently. Company is not responsible for any breaches of a user’s profile and access to their Personal Information, which is attributed to lost or stolen user
                    names and passwords. In the event of an inadvertent disclosure of a user’s user name and password, users are advised to change their password as soon as they become aware of such disclosure.
